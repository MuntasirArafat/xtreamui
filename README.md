- Configure firewall and open port 22
Before enabling the UFW firewall we need to add a rule which will allow incoming SSH connections. If youâ€™re connecting to your server from a remote location, which is almost always the case and you enable the UFW firewall before explicitly allow incoming SSH connections you will no longer be able to connect to your Ubuntu server.
To configure your UFW firewall to allow incoming SSH connections, type the following command:

$ sudo ufw allow ssh



- Now we can enable UFW firewall by typing:
$ sudo ufw enable



- You can check the status of UFW with the following command:
$ sudo ufw status
